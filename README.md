## ❓ What is Hider 2?

**Hider 2** for macOS is a minimal yet powerful utility that allows you to **instantly hide and encrypt files or folders** on your Mac. It creates a secure vault and gives you full control over your sensitive data — all with one click.

Unlike basic hiding tools, Hider 2 **encrypts everything with AES-256**, runs fully offline, and is optimized for both **Intel** and **Apple Silicon** Macs. Whether you're hiding client files, personal documents, or private folders, it's all safely stored in a password-protected interface.

The app runs smoothly on **macOS Sonoma**, **Ventura**, and **Monterey**, and includes menu bar shortcuts, auto-lock, and clean integration into your workspace.
